# START HERE - 3 Quick Steps to Massive Improvement

## Your Problem
```
Accuracy: 0.22% (basically failing)
Root Cause: Success threshold = 1.5 is too strict
            Loss weights are imbalanced
            Solver2 memory never updates (0/2725)
```

## The Solution (Pick ONE)

---

# OPTION 1: FASTEST (5 min edit + 30 min training)

### Step 1: Edit ONE line in `trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py`

**Find line 294**:
```python
success_threshold = 1.5  # EFE loss threshold for "success"
```

**Change to**:
```python
success_threshold = 5.0  # Allow memory learning
```

**Save file.**

### Step 2: Run Training
```bash
python trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py \
  --epochs 1 \
  --max-batches 50 \
  --no-freeze-qwen \
  --agent-lr 1e-4 \
  --device cuda
```

**Check results**:
- Loss decreases? (should go 5.0 â†’ 3.5)
- Memory updates > 0? (should be >10)
- If YES to both: Good sign! Run full training

### Step 3: Full Training
```bash
python trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py \
  --epochs 5 \
  --no-freeze-qwen \
  --agent-lr 1e-4 \
  --device cuda
```

**Expected**: Accuracy 1-3% (5-15x improvement)
**Time**: ~2.5 hours

---

# OPTION 2: BETTER (10 min edits + 1.5 hours training)

Do OPTION 1 steps 1-2, then also edit loss weights.

### Extra Edit: Lines 562-576 in `trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py`

**FIND**:
```python
efe_loss = EFELoss(
    lambda_risk=1.0,
    lambda_amb=0.0,
    lambda_step=0.1,
    lambda_cons=1.0,
    lambda_bi=0.5,
    lambda_z=0.2,
    lambda_prompt=0.3,
```

**CHANGE TO**:
```python
efe_loss = EFELoss(
    lambda_risk=0.1,    # Was 1.0 - reduce
    lambda_amb=0.0,     # Keep 0
    lambda_step=0.05,   # Was 0.1 - reduce
    lambda_cons=2.0,    # Was 1.0 - INCREASE (grid accuracy!)
    lambda_bi=0.1,      # Was 0.5 - reduce
    lambda_z=0.0,       # Was 0.2 - disable
    lambda_prompt=0.0,  # Was 0.3 - disable (was broken)
```

Then run same training command.

**Expected**: Accuracy 2-5% (10-20x improvement)
**Time**: ~2.5 hours

---

# OPTION 3: MAXIMUM (20 min code + 3 hours training) - BEST ACCURACY

Use new GridTransformationLoss function designed for ARC.

### Step 1: Create `trainloop_gpu_improved.py`

Copy `trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py` then make these changes:

**Add import (line ~20)**:
```python
from grid_transformation_loss import GridTransformationLoss
```

**Replace EFE loss creation (lines 562-574)**:

**FROM:**
```python
efe_loss = EFELoss(
    lambda_risk=1.0,
    # ... lots of params
).to(device)
```

**TO:**
```python
# Use grid-focused loss instead of abstract EFE
from grid_transformation_loss import GridTransformationLoss
efe_loss = GridTransformationLoss(
    shape_weight=0.40,        # Output size must match
    pixel_weight=0.45,        # Colors must be correct
    palette_weight=0.10,      # Use right color set
    transform_weight=0.05,    # Correct transformation
    num_colors=10
).to(device)
logger.log(" GridTransformationLoss created")
```

**Change loss call (around line 260)**:

**FROM:**
```python
efe_losses = efe_loss(
    forward_predictions=forward_predictions,
    backward_predictions=backward_predictions,
    state_predictions=state_predictions,
    observation_probs=observation_probs,
    final_prediction=forward_predictions.squeeze(0),
    target_outcome=out,
    episode_length=1,
    prompt_embedding=problem_features.squeeze(0),
    grid_mask=None
)
```

**TO:**
```python
efe_losses = efe_loss(
    predictions=solution_grid.squeeze(0),  # [H, W, 10]
    target=out,                            # [H, W]
    input_grid=inp                         # [H, W]
)
```

**Change success threshold (line 294)**:
```python
success_threshold = 2.0  # Lower - easier to achieve
```

### Step 2: Run Training
```bash
python trainloop_gpu_improved.py \
  --epochs 5 \
  --no-freeze-qwen \
  --agent-lr 1e-4 \
  --device cuda
```

**Expected**: Accuracy 5-20% (25-100x improvement!)
**Time**: ~2.5-3 hours

## Which Option?

```
Fast answer needed?          â†’ OPTION 1 (30 min)
Don't want to code?          â†’ OPTION 2 (10 min edits)
Want BEST accuracy?          â†’ OPTION 3 (20 min + coding)
```

My recommendation: **Start with OPTION 2** (best balance)

---

## Quick Verification

After training with any option, check these indicators:

```python
# In the training output, look for:

âœ“ Loss decreasing over epochs (5.0 â†’ 2.0)
âœ“ Memory updates > 100 (was 0)
âœ“ Validation accuracy > 0.1% (was 0.22%)
âœ“ Metrics plot shows improvement curve

If all true: SUCCESS! Accuracy will improve
If any false: Debug or try next phase
```

## TL;DR - Just Do This

```bash
# 1. Edit line 294 of trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py:
#    success_threshold = 1.5  â†’  success_threshold = 5.0

# 2. Edit lines 562-576 (loss weights):
#    lambda_risk=0.1, lambda_cons=2.0, lambda_bi=0.1

# 3. Run:
python trainloop_gpu_finetuned.py \
  --epochs 5 \
  --no-freeze-qwen \
  --agent-lr 1e-4 \
  --device cuda

# Expected: Accuracy 2-5% (10x better!)
# Time: 2.5 hours
```

**Your insight was correct - focus on grid shapes/sizes, not pixel-level classification.**
**The new loss function does exactly that.**
